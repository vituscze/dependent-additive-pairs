# Programming with Dependent Additive Pairs

Here you can find the accompanying implementation in the [Janus](https://github.com/svobot/janus) language.

The examples are split into multiple files:
* [Linear list paramorphism](paramorphism.jns) (section 5.1)
* [Linear partition operation with a proof](partition.jns) (section 5.2)
* [Linear insertion operation with a proof](insert.jns) (sections 5.1 and 5.2)
* [Additive inductive lists](additivelist.jns) (section 5.3)
* [Additive coinductive streams](stream.jns) (section 5.3)
